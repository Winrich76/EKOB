Application program EKOB supports managing technical documentation of buildings. It is still being developed. Currently it solves problems with technical  surveys. You can select from a dozen survey types. EKOB automatically sets correct validity date. In the main view you can sort surveys by building, types or statuses. Details of surveys are displayed there. If survey is out of date program displays proper message. It  automatically moves old surveys into archives.  You can also add pdf files.
